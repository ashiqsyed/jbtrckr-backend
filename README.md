# jbtrckr-backend

This is the backend for my personal project, jbtrckr, which is a job application tracker. It is built using Java Spring Boot in order to get more experience in using Java
for full stack development. I will be using a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container, and the Spring Boot application will be run on my local machine.
